# Arkanoid Game OOP 
## Project Overview
This project is an advanced implementation of the classic **Arkanoid** game in **Java**, designed with **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.  
The game features multiple creative levels, dynamic mechanics, and ends with a challenging **Final Boss stage**.  
The purpose of the project was to practice modular design, design patterns, and best practices in software engineering while developing a fun interactive game.

## Features 
- **Game Mechanics**: Paddle movement, ball control, brick collision detection, scoring system, and multiple balls support.  
- **Levels**: Includes several stages such as *Sunny Day*, *Moonlight*, and a final **Boss Fight**.  
- **Graphics**: Simple, colorful GUI designed with `java.awt` and `javax.swing`.  
- **OOP Principles**: Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Interfaces, and use of patterns like Observer.  
- **Extensibility**: Code structured for reusability – easy to add new levels or modify mechanics.
